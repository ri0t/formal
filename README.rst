Formal!
=======

A Python library for object document mapping with MongoDB and SQL
dialects(WiP) using JSON schema.

Description
-----------

This is a package for generating classes from a JSON-schema that are to be
saved in MongoDB or SQL and (un)pickled via Python's builtin json module or
others like simplejson or ujson.

This extends the JSON schema by supporting extra BSON types:

-  ObjectId - use the ``"object_id"`` type in your JSON schema to
   validate that
   a field is a valid ObjectId.
-  datetime - use the ``"date"`` type in your JSON schema to validate
   that a field
   is a valid datetime

Usage
-----

1) Build your schema

::

        >>> schema = {
            'name': 'Country',
            'id': '#country',
            'properties': {
                'name': {'type': 'string'},
                'abbreviation': {'type': 'string'},
            },
            'additionalProperties': False,
        }

2) Connect to your database

::

        >>> import formal
        >>> formal.connect("test")

3) Create a model

::

        >>> Country = formal.model_factory(schema)

4) Create an object using your model

::

        >>> sweden = Country({"name": 'Sweden', "abbreviation": 'SE'})
        >>> sweden.save()
        >>> sweden._id
        ObjectId('50b506916ee7d81d42ca2190')

5) Let the object validate itself!

::

        >>> sweden = Country.find_one({"name" : "Sweden"})
        >>> sweden.name = 5
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
          File "formal/model.py", line 254, in __setattr__
            self.validate_field(attr, self._schema["properties"][attr], value)
          File "formal/model.py", line 189, in validate_field
            self.validate_simple(key, value_schema, value)
          File "formal/model.py", line 236, in validate_simple
            (key, value_type, str(value), type(value)))
        formal.exceptions.ValidationError: Field 'name' is of type 'string', received '5' (<type 'int'>)

        >>> sweden.overlord = 'Bears'
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
          File "formal/model.py", line 257, in __setattr__
            raise ValidationError("Additional property '%s' not allowed!" % attr)
        formal.exceptions.ValidationError: Additional property 'overlord' not allowed!

6) You can also update objects from dictionaries:

::

        >>> sweden.update({"name": "Sverige"})
        >>> sweden.save()

7) To get them to a browser or other similar things, serialize them:

::

        >>> sweden.serializablefields()
        {'_id': '50b506916ee7d81d42ca2190', 'name': 'Sverige', 'abbreviation': 'SE', 'id': '#country'}

Choosing a collection
---------------------

| By default Formal will use the pluralized version of the model's name.
  If
| you want to use something else, put it in the JSON-schema:

::

        {
            "name": "MyModel",
            ...
            "collectionName": "some_collection",
            ...
        }

Multiple Databases
------------------

To use multiple databases, simply call ``connect()`` multiple times:

::

        >>> import formal
        >>> formal.connect("test")
        >>> formal.connect("other_db")

| By default all models will use the first database specified. If you
  want to use
| a different one, put it in the JSON-schema:

::

        {
            "name": "MyModel",
            ...
            "databaseName": "other_db",
            ...
        }

SQL Operation
-------------

..is still work in progress.

Roadmap
=======

We have many plans for the future:

-  Complete SQL support including:

   -  JSON document storage
   -  GeoJSON queries

-  Time series support
-  Support for consensus algorithms like Paxos or Raft
-  Automatic data migration (up and down)
-  Improved testing

   -  multiple interpreters via tox
   -  complete coverage
   -  more tests

Ping us, if you'd like to contribute!

History
=======

Formal is a fork of warmongo, originally written by Rob Britton.

Things that have changed:

-  jsonschema is now truly used to validate objects (it validates far
   more than just basetypes)
-  we do ignore mongo's object\_id - not sure if this is a good thing,
   but it helps with the schemata
-  we require (by spec) an 'id' field that lists a uri for the schema
-  the resulting field is enforced on instantiated objects, too, so
   clients can validate by schema-id

Work in progress:

-  Migration of versioned object models
-  SQL integration
-  Deep dot notation
-  Delta operation for concurrent editing and object history

Production Examples
===================

| The Isomer framework uses Formal as object document mapping system to
  deal with data objects in a developer and
| enduser friendly way.
| See it in action on http://github.com/isomeric/isomer

| The original author uses Warmongo every day at his startup
  http://www.sweetiq.com/ to share data
| definitions between their Python and Node.js applications. It has been
  running in
| production for some time now, so it has been reasonably tested for
  robustness and performance.
